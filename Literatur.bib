abstract="Of all the Extreme Programming practices, continuous integration is one of the least controversial -- the benefits of an integrated, streamlined build process is something that software developers immediately recognise. However, as a project scales up in size and complexity, continuous integration can become increasingly hard to practice successfully. By focussing on the problems associated with a growing project, this paper describes a variety of strategies for successfully scaling continuous integration.",
